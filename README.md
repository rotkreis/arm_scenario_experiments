# Install

Clone this repository into your catkin workspace "src" folder  
In the catkin_ws folder, run
```
catkin_make
```

In arm_scenario_experiments run :
```
./after_install.sh
```

# Description

This package contains the code needed to carry out data collection and experiments with the `arm_scenario_simulator` package.
Basically, this fork is only used to generate baxter pushing button data.

# How to augment data a little bit (needed)

You can modify color of table in : `catkin_ws/src/arm_scenario_simulator/models/DREAM_table/model.sdf`
just change line 36 :

`<name>Gazebo/SkyBlue</name>`
to
`<name>Gazebo/Red</name>`  for exemple

See  `/usr/share/gazebo-2.2/media/materials/scripts/gazebo.material` for other material available (you can try to create your own if you want)

The color of button is selected randomly

If you want to change button position see `catkin_ws/src/arm_scenario_experiments/scripts/button_pressing/button_babbler` line 46

# Instruction to record sequences :

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/arm_scenario_experiments
./process
```


Wait for gazebo and open a new terminal window
```
rosrun arm_scenario_simulator spawn_objects_example
```

open a new terminal window
```
rosrun arm_scenario_experiments button_babbler here
```

The script will launch, creating sequences of images in record_X directory in 'here'

# Preprocessing to use SRL and RL
The preprocessing script for using [SRL Methods](https://github.com/araffin/srl-zoo) is located in `scripts/preprocess/`.

```
python preprocess.py [--data-folder DATA_FOLDER] [--mode MODE] [--no-warnings]

--data-folder DATA_FOLDER
                      Dataset folder name
--mode MODE           Preprocessing mode: One of "image_net", "tf".
--no-warnings         disables warnings
```

e.g.
```
python preprocess.py --data-folder staticButtonSimplest
```


#Error you can get (because sometimes, ros hates you)

`OSError: [Errno 110] Failed to get robot state on robot/state`
Just relauch the script a few times, it will work

`Service IK error`
Meaning : Moving the arm is not possible for an unknown reason...
Usulally, restarting ros and gazebo seems to do the trick, but ugly ...
